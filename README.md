# Web App Deployment on Kubernetes Cluster

## Requirements
- **High Availability**: Ensure that the web application remains accessible even in the face of failures.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle failures gracefully without causing downtime or data loss.
- **Easily Scalable**: Ability to scale the application horizontally to accommodate varying loads.
- **Platform Independent**: Kubernetes should provide a consistent deployment environment irrespective of the underlying infrastructure.
- **Portable and Flexible**: The deployment setup should be easily transferable across different environments and flexible to accommodate changes.

## Technologies Used
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing and automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.
- **Java Stack**: Utilizing Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, and MySQL as part of the application stack.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up Kubernetes Cluster.
  2. Containerize applications.
  3. Create EBS volume for the database.
  4. Pod labeling with zone names.
  5. Kubernetes Definition files for Deployment, Service, Secret, Volume.

## Deployment Steps
1. **Setting up Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Follow the documentation to set up a Kubernetes cluster according to your infrastructure and requirements.
  
2. **Containerized Apps**:
   - Containerize your Java applications using Docker.
   - Ensure each component of the Java stack (Nginx, Tomcat, RabbitMQ, MySQL) is containerized properly.
   
3. **Create EBS Volume for DB**:
   - Set up an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume in your cloud provider's dashboard or via CLI for MySQL database storage.

4. **Pod Labeling with Zone Names**:
   - Label Kubernetes nodes with zone names to ensure that pods are deployed across different availability zones for fault tolerance and high availability.

5. **Kubernetes Definition Files**:
   - Create YAML files for Kubernetes resources:
     - Deployment: Define how many instances of each container should run and their configurations.
     - Service: Expose the deployment to the external world.
     - Secret: Store sensitive data like passwords, API keys securely.
     - Volume: Define persistent volume claims for MySQL database storage.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up.
3. Modify the Kubernetes definition files according to your application's configuration.
4. Apply the YAML files using `kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>` to deploy the application on the Kubernetes cluster.
